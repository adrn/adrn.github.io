Molly Peeples ([@astronomolly](https://twitter.com/astronomolly)) recently
tweeted [some really cool
plots](https://twitter.com/astronomolly/status/749675563539890176) from
[timeanddate.com](http://www.timeanddate.com/sun/uk/edinburgh) that visualize
local solar properties over a year from a location (e.g., twilights, solar noon,
etc.), e.g.:

My first thought was: can we make those plots with Astropy? This post shows one
way to make figures like this in Python using [Astropy](http://www.astropy.org)
and [Matplotlib](http://www.matplotlib.org).

First, some imports:

{% notebook yearly-sun-graph.ipynb cells[0:] %}

---

Download the function to produce these plots [from this
Gist](https://gist.github.com/adrn/b1d7dcef1865777d40cbcd39ade9da65).

See the [full notebook
here](https://github.com/adrn/adrn.github.io-source/content/notebooks/yearly-sun-graph.ipynb).
