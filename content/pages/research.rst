My main research ranges from small-scale dynamics of two-body systems to the
disruption of globular clusters and satellites of the Milky Way. I've therefore
spent a lot of time thinking about current and future surveys of Milky Way stars
and how to use these data to infer its dynamical history and structure. I'm
particularly excited about the `Gaia mission
<https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/gaia>`_ and am a co-organizer of the `Gaia
sprints <http://gaia.lol>`_.

My general interest in statistical inference and dynamics has also led me to
projects on binary stars, supermassive black holes, and calibration of the
distance ladder.
