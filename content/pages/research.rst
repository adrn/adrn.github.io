I'm generally interested in dynamics and statistical inference; my research has
therefore spanned a large range of topics, from small-scale dynamics of two-body
systems to the disruption of globular clusters and satellites of the Milky Way.
I've spent a lot of time thinking about current and future surveys of Milky Way
stars and how to use these data to infer its dynamical history and stellar
constituents.

research and as a co-organizer of the `Gaia sprints <http://gaia.lol>`_.
