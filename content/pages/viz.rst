Stellar streams:
================

Interactive:
------------

* `Stellar streams around the Milky Way <http://adrian.pw/visualizations/mwstreams/>`_
* `Globular cluster streams simulated in the Via Lactea 2 simulation <http://adrian.pw/visualizations/vl2/>`_
* `Stellar stream maker <http://adrian.pw/visualizations/streams/>`_

Movies:
-------

This set of movies shows the tidal disruption of a star cluster as it orbits in
a (very simple) model for our galaxy, the Milky Way. The stars that get pulled
out of the star cluster form "leading" and "trailing" tails that make up a
"stream" of stars. Streams are useful because they roughly delineate the past
and future trajectory of an object (i.e. the progenitor star cluster). In the
first movie, the green line shows the orbit of the star cluster around the
galaxy (left panel), and the red and blue points represent stars that were once
bound to the cluster but have now been pulled out by the tidal field of the
Galaxy and now form a leading tail (red points) and trailing tail (blue points).
the right panel shows the formation of the stream in a reference frame that
rotates with the star cluster.
The second movie shows the formation of the stream in a different set of
phase-space coordinates: "action-angle" coordinates.

Binary stars:
=============

A gallery of binary star systems with different mass ratios (q) and different
eccentricities (e), as labeled. The first video shows a view of the orbital
plane of the system, and the second video shows the radial velocity signal from
each star when viewed edge on and with all relevant angles in the Kepler problem
set to 0 (e.g., argument of pericenter). These two videos are time-synced.
