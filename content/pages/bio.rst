I received my PhD in 2016 with advisor `Kathryn V. Johnston
<http://user.astro.columbia.edu/~kvj/>`_ in the Department of Astronomy at
Columbia University. I was then a Lyman Spitzer, Jr. Postdoctoral Fellow in the
`Department of Astrophysical Sciences <www.astro.princeton.edu>`_ at Princeton
University. Now, I am a postdoctoral fellow at the Flatiron Institute in NYC.

I used to play bass in `Operator Music Band
