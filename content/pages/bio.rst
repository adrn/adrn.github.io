I received my PhD in 2016 with advisor `Kathryn V. Johnston
<http://user.astro.columbia.edu/~kvj/>`_ in the Department of Astronomy at
Columbia University. I was then a Lyman Spitzer, Jr. Postdoctoral Fellow in the
`Department of Astrophysical Sciences <www.astro.princeton.edu>`_ at Princeton
University. I was a Flatiron Reserach Fellow at the Center for Comuptational
Astrophysics (CCA) at the Flatiron Institute in NYC from 2019 to 2021, and am
now an Associate Research Scientist at the CCA.

I used to play bass in `Operator Music Band
