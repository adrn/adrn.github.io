I recently co-taught a graduate student seminar at Princeton (AST 542) on
machine learning and statistics. All of my lecture materials (primarily jupyter
notebooks) are `available on GitHub <https://github.com/adrn/ast542>`_ - feel
free to use or modify these or any other tutorials of mine!

I've led or taught at several workshops on computational methods and statistics
(Python programming, machine learning, open source software, and statistics) at
many different venues (the AAS winter meeting, the `Scicoder workshop
<http://scicoder.org>`_, `AstroHackWeek <http://astrohackweek.org>`_,
undergraduate and graduate student seminars at Columbia University and Princeton
University). `All supplementary materials are available on GitHub
<https://github.com/search?q=topic%3Aadrn-teaching+fork%3Atrue&type=Repositories>`_.
