I recently co-taught a graduate student seminar at Princeton (AST 542) on
machine learning and statistics. All of my lecture materials (primarily jupyter
notebooks) are `available on GitHub <https://github.com/adrn/ast542>`_.

I've led or taught at several workshops on computational methods and statistics
(Python programming, machine learning, open source software, and statistics) at
many different venues (the AAS winter meeting, the `Scicoder workshop
<http://scicoder.org>`_, `AstroHackWeek <http://astrohackweek.org>`_,
undergraduate and graduate student seminars at Columbia University and Princeton
University).
