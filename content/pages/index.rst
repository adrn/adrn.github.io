I'm a 2nd year postdoc in the `Department of Astrophysical Sciences
<www.astro.princeton.edu>`_ at Princeton University. [`bio </bio.html>`_]

My main research is in the structure and formation of the Milky Way, but my
general interest in statistics has led me to a variety of projects from binary
stars to supermassive black holes. [`publications </pubs.html>`_]

I'm passionate about open source software and open science. [`code

I very occasionally write a blog post or tutorial of general interest.
