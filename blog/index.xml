      <description>A problem I have frequently run into in astronomical data analysis is the need to infer parameters of a density model in which some aspects of the model are allowed to be flexible and other components are held more rigid (i.e. with a parametrized model). In these contexts, we are sometimes also interested in learning a flexible representation of the expected number or number density of objects along with a probability density function.</description>
