      <description>A problem I have run into frequently in astronomical data analysis is the need to infer parameters of a density model where some aspects of the model are allowed to be flexible and other components are held more rigid. In these contexts, we are also sometimes interested in learning a flexible representation for the density of sources itself. This post demonstrates how to implement models with flexibility controlled by spline interpolation of function values in JAX.</description>
